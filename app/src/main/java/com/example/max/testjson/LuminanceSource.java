 * The purpose of this class hierarchy is to abstract different bitmap implementations across
 * platforms into a standard interface for requesting greyscale luminance values. The interface
 * only provides immutable methods; therefore crop and rotation create copies. This is to ensure
 * that one Reader does not modify the original luminance source and leave it in an unknown state
 * for other Readers in the chain.
 *
 * The code for this class was adapted from the ZXing project: http://code.google.com/p/zxing
